# prep_course_ruby_remote
remote repository for intro programming to ruby within the prep coure only

This repository was created to accompany an online course I am following to teach myself Ruby.
It contains my answers to exercises prescribed by the course. Though this repo does not contain 
much, it is a good way for me to track of completed exercises. I am still adding to it as I go along.
